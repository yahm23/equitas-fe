# Changes I made
- Render an image for each card from the API data
- As the same images were used I decided to randomly pick an image from provided images
- Added the ability to open each card as a modal to reveal more information about the specific launch
- The modal content can be extended to all the data available (provided enough logic exists + data exists)
- General styling and responsiveness as well as rough look and feel*

# Changes I didn't get to
- I was aiming to style the pagination and extend it further to allow picking a specific page number
- *I was aiming to add custom fonts and images for the header and content throughout, e.g. icons for buttons, and large hero image and a more polished card + modal
